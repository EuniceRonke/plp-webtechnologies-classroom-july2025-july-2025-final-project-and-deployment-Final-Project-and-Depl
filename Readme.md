SkillUp Website
📌 Project Overview

This is my final web development assignment: a responsive, interactive, multi-page website built with HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. The site demonstrates proper planning, structure, styling, and interactivity. It is organized into four main pages:

Home – introduction to SkillUp and navigation to other sections.

About – mission and purpose of the platform.

Courses – overview of courses with Freemium and Premium options.

Contact – contact form with validation.

The website is responsive, has a consistent design, and includes interactive features like theme toggle, animations, and form validation.

🛠️ Tech Stack

HTML5 – semantic page structure

CSS3 – responsive layout, animations, styling

JavaScript – interactivity (theme toggle, form validation, animations)
